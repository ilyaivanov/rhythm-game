Idea of a prototype
Create a shooting game (close to Geometry Wars or Nova Drift), but the game is heavily influenced by music. The key question for the prototype - can I create a game where influence is not just visual\aethtetic, but affects mechanics of the game, like when enemies spawn, when they shot, how they move, etc. 

I probably need either a separate tool or integrated into a game, which would allow me to place markers into a track. 

Extra Ideas
- There are many monster types (walker, chaser, etc). What are some monster variations? 
    - small, middle and big like in Pixel Purge
    - bosses and minions like in diablo 2


Difficulty Parameters
- Monster speed, fire rate, spawn time. 
- Extra monsters, probability of harder monsters


How music affects gameplay
- Monster can spawn on a beat
- Extract different types of beat, so that different things can happen on different types of beats. 
- Monster can fire, dodge, move, teleport on a beat

Prototype 0.1v 
Create a game which is a bare bones of pixelars or geometry wars. You move the player around, shot different types of enemies, have regular sound, minimal power-ups. Just to get overall infra into place. 
Features: 
    - Types of monsters: walker, chaser, circular shooter, wall crawling shooter
    - Increasing difficulty
    - Particle effects 
    - Animations for enemies appear, die, shot
    - Audio framework for circular buffer
    - Player health
    - Game state: Start, Gaming, End
    - HUDs: score, difficulty, killed, maybe XP? 
    - Leveling? 
    - Power-ups? 

Backlog
1. Set isAlive for bullets out of screen
2. Better player controls
3. Steering behaviour for chasing enemies. Consider Brotato as a good example, where enemies follow you ,but do not join into the exact same postion on the screen. 
4. Check Nova Drif as an example how they handle different screen resolutions 

Random Ideas
1. Brotato has a time-based levels, which suit me good in terms of track length. Maybe I can create a similar to brotato mechanics, but focus on music affecting enemies. 


Day 1 08.06.24 Sat
Bootstrap a project. Software renderer. Add an example of OpenGL renderer from my previous project. 

Day 2 09.06.24 Sun
Start writing game logic - player movement, enemy movement and spawning, fire bullets and first steps to collision detection. Add a random generator from Handmande Hero day 457 sourcecode

Day 3 10.06.24 Mon
Plan: different types of enemies, better collision. 
8:40 - 8:50 writing this document
9:20 - 9:40 better rect collision
9:40 - 10:20 working on a Wall Walker enemy type    
11:00 - 11:10working on this document


Steps to 0.1v
    - Finish with fonts
    - Show score (monsters killed for now) and spawn rate
    - Gradualy increase spawn rate, monster average speed, monster types to spawn. Add chances to spawn several monsters at the same time. 
    - Automatically shot every 3 bullets per second
    - Add 3 health points. Add immunity for 2 seconds after hit. 
    - Add 3 game states. Start, game and end.
    ? I have difficulty increasing, I don't have any means to increase power of the player. 
    - Powerups
       - For now increase rate of fire each 10 kills. New bullet on 50 kills. 
       - Or monsters can drop permanent boosts, like fire rate, bullet count
    - Add small imprecision to player shots. 
    - Add player speed to bullets speed.  
*** At this stage I have a minimal playable game with set of parameters to change ***

Variations in the game
- Monster types and their variations
- Leveling and skills
- Different Characters 
- Drops
- Locations
- Bosses
- Progressions (like a tree of different levels, like on Geometry Wars 3)
- Resets

Each level is a different song. In order to finish it, I need to listen to song to the end and survive.
