Idea of a prototype
Create a shooting game (close to Geometry Wars or Nova Drift), but the game is heavily influenced by music. The key question for the prototype - can I create a game where influence is not just visual\aethtetic, but affects mechanics of the game, like when enemies spawn, when they shot, how they move, etc. 

I probably need either a separate tool or integrated into a game, which would allow me to place markers into a track. 


Prototype 0.1v 
Create a game which is a bare bones of pixelars or geometry wars. You move the player around, shot different types of enemies, have regular sound, minimal power-ups. Just to get overall infra into place. 
Features: 
    - Types of monsters: walker, chaser, circular shooter, wall crawling shooter
    - Increasing difficulty
    - Particle effects 
    - Animations for enemies appear, die, shot
    - Audio framework for circular buffer
    - Player health
    - Game state: Start, Gaming, End
    - HUDs: score, difficulty, killed, maybe XP? 
    - Leveling? 
    - Power-ups? 

Backlog
1. Set isAlive for bullets out of screen
2. Better player controls

Day 1 08.06.24 Sat
Bootstrap a project. Software renderer. Add an example of OpenGL renderer from my previous project. 

Day 2 09.06.24 Sun
Start writing game logic - player movement, enemy movement and spawning, fire bullets and first steps to collision detection. Add a random generator from Handmande Hero day 457 sourcecode

Day 3 10.06.24 Mon
Plan: different types of enemies, better collision. 
8:40 - 8:50 writing this document
9:20 - 9:40 better rect collision
9:40 - 10:20 working on a Wall Walker enemy type
