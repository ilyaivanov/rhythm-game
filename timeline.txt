Idea of a prototype
Create a shooting game (close to Geometry Wars or Nova Drift), but the game is heavily influenced by music. The key question for the prototype - can I create a game where influence is not just visual\aethtetic, but affects mechanics of the game, like when enemies spawn, when they shot, how they move, etc. 

I probably need either a separate tool or integrated into a game, which would allow me to place markers into a track. 

Extra Ideas
- There are many monster types (walker, chaser, etc). What are some monster variations? 
    - small, middle and big like in Pixel Purge
    - bosses and minions like in diablo 2


Difficulty Parameters
- Monster speed, fire rate, spawn time. 
- Extra monsters, probability of harder monsters


How music affects gameplay
- Monster can spawn on a beat
- Extract different types of beat, so that different things can happen on different types of beats. 
- Monster can fire, dodge, move, teleport on a beat

Prototype 0.1v 
Create a game which is a bare bones of pixelars or geometry wars. You move the player around, shot different types of enemies, have regular sound, minimal power-ups. Just to get overall infra into place. 
Features: 
    - Types of monsters: walker, chaser, circular shooter, wall crawling shooter
    - Increasing difficulty
    - Particle effects 
    - Animations for enemies appear, die, shot
    - Audio framework for circular buffer
    - Player health
    - Game state: Start, Gaming, End
    - HUDs: score, difficulty, killed, maybe XP? 
    - Leveling? 
    - Power-ups? 

Backlog
1. Set isAlive for bullets out of screen
2. Better player controls
3. Steering behaviour for chasing enemies. Consider Brotato as a good example, where enemies follow you ,but do not join into the exact same postion on the screen. 
4. Check Nova Drif as an example how they handle different screen resolutions 
5. Drawing font (monospaced Consolas) via OpenGL
6. Extract and localize all OpenGL specific stuff
7. Extract all state. This is simply dependencies and will allow to start game in arbitrary state for quickier testing. 


Random Ideas
1. Brotato has a time-based levels, which suit me good in terms of track length. Maybe I can create a similar to brotato mechanics, but focus on music affecting enemies. 
2. Slow music might be more challanging by triggering more events per rhytm. For example spawnign 20 enemies with interesting pattern on tick. 

Day 1 08.06.24 Sat
Bootstrap a project. Software renderer. Add an example of OpenGL renderer from my previous project. 

Day 2 09.06.24 Sun
Start writing game logic - player movement, enemy movement and spawning, fire bullets and first steps to collision detection. Add a random generator from Handmande Hero day 457 sourcecode

Day 3 10.06.24 Mon
Plan: different types of enemies, better collision. 
08:40 - 08:50 writing this document
09:20 - 09:40 better rect collision
09:40 - 10:20 working on a Wall Walker enemy type    
11:00 - 11:10 working on this document
12:10 - 12:15 random float one to zero 
12:40 - 13:10 random enemy speed. Walker firing at you
13:35 - 13:45 Particle Effect (start)
14:30 - 15:20 Particle Effect - explosions on enemy hit
17:30 - 17:50 Font rendering via OpenGL (start)



Day 4 11.06.24 Tue
10:30 - 11:30 working on undestanding how I draw textures via OpenGL by breaking down yafe2 project
 finished font support. Working on drawing label with numbers on the screen

Steps to 0.1v
    ▲ Finish with fonts
    ▲ Show score (monsters killed for now) and spawn rate
    ▲ Gradualy increase (just spawn rate for now is ok)
        ▲ spawn rate
        x monster average speed
        x monster types to spawn. 
        x Add chances to spawn several monsters at the same time. 
    ▼ Automatically shot every 3 bullets per second
    ▲ Add 3 health points. Add immunity for 2 seconds after hit. 
    ▲ Add 3 game states. Start, game and end.
    ? I have difficulty designing player power increase, I don't have any means to increase power of the player. 
    ▼ Powerups
       - For now increase rate of fire each 10 kills. New bullet on 50 kills. 
       - Or monsters can drop permanent boosts, like fire rate, bullet count
    ▼ Add small imprecision to player shots. 
    ▼ Add player speed to bullets speed.  
*** At this stage I have a minimal playable game with set of parameters to change ***

Steps to 0.2v
    - Finish handmade section on sounds (4 parts)
    - Add simple sounds to the game
    - Pick a minimal track (2-3 mins)
    - Start denoting simple beats of that track



Variations in the game
- Monster types and their variations
- Leveling and skills
- Different Characters 
- Drops
- Locations
- Bosses
- Progressions (like a tree of different levels, like on Geometry Wars 3)
- Resets
- Coherency (meaning different systems work together to progress you in the game, so that you can experience different content, like bosses, locations, levels, epic drops, etc)

Each level is a different song. In order to finish it, I need to listen to song to the end and survive. 


Day 5 12.06.24 Wed
11:10 - 12:10 finishing with the HUD system. Drawing labels, numbers, floats on the screen. Introduced spawn acceleration and score.
13:50 - 14:40 player hitpoints drawn as a bar. Three game states: start, game and end. 
15:25 - 16:10 starting working on a audio. Watching episode 7 HMH on audio


Day 6 13.06.24 Thu
11:20 - 17:30 (with huge breaks) watching episode 8,9 and working on audio. Debugging why 256 Hz is not stable for f32. Visualize audio samples using OpenGL. 

Day 7 14.06.24 Fri
19:00 - 19:50 playing wav file. Converted deadmau5 track to wav via ffmpeg
19:50 - Thinking how to convert 44100 bitrate to 48000
