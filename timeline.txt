Idea of a prototype
Create a shooting game (close to Geometry Wars or Nova Drift), but the game is heavily influenced by music. The key question for the prototype - can I create a game where influence is not just visual\aethtetic, but affects mechanics of the game, like when enemies spawn, when they shot, how they move, etc. 


Prototype 0.1v 
Create a game which is a bare bones of pixelars or geometry wars. You move the player around, shot different types of enemies, have regular sound, minimal power-ups. Just to get overall infra into place.
