Idea of a prototype
Create a shooting game (close to Geometry Wars or Nova Drift), but the game is heavily influenced by music. The key question for the prototype - can I create a game where influence is not just visual\aethtetic, but affects mechanics of the game, like when enemies spawn, when they shot, how they move, etc. 

I probably need either a separate tool or integrated into a game, which would allow me to place markers into a track. 


Prototype 0.1v 
Create a game which is a bare bones of pixelars or geometry wars. You move the player around, shot different types of enemies, have regular sound, minimal power-ups. Just to get overall infra into place. 
Features: 
    - Types of monsters: walker, chaser, circular shooter, wall crawling shooter
    - Increasing difficulty
    - Particle effects 
    - Animations for enemies appear, die, shot
    - Audio framework for circular buffer
    - Player health
    - Game state: Start, Gaming, End
    - HUDs: score, difficulty, killed, maybe XP? 
    - Leveling? 
    - Power-ups? 

Backlog
1. Set isAlive for bullets out of screen
2. Better player controls
3. Steering behaviour for chasing enemies. Consider Brotato as a good example, where enemies follow you ,but do not join into the exact same postion on the screen. 
4. Check Nova Drif as an example how they handle different screen resolutions 
5. Drawing font (monospaced Consolas) via OpenGL

Random Ideas
1. Brotato has a time-based levels, which suit me good in terms of track length. Maybe I can create a similar to brotato mechanics, but focus on music affecting enemies. 


Day 1 08.06.24 Sat
Bootstrap a project. Software renderer. Add an example of OpenGL renderer from my previous project. 

Day 2 09.06.24 Sun
Start writing game logic - player movement, enemy movement and spawning, fire bullets and first steps to collision detection. Add a random generator from Handmande Hero day 457 sourcecode
